# 2-Minute Interview Demo Script

## 🎯 Opening Statement (15 seconds)

**"I'd like to share my trading performance dashboard that shows my evolution from learning to systematic trading over the past 7 months."**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary (30 seconds)

**Show: Executive Summary Section**

**Script:**
"This dashboard tracks my FY 2024-25 trading journey. You can see I started with a learning phase in Q1 where I took losses of around ₹15,600 - but this was intentional. I used this period to understand what works and what doesn't.

The key turning point was Q2, where I became highly systematic in derivatives trading. This disciplined approach led to 3 consecutive profitable months with a 100% win rate, generating ₹10,246 in profit."

## 📈 Key Visualization (30 seconds)

**Show: Monthly P&L Chart OR Systematic vs Emotional Chart**

**Script:**
"This chart tells the story best. The green bars show my systematic derivative trading on Kotak in Q2 - you can see the consistency: July, August, September - all profitable.

The red and orange bars show where I deviated from my system - commodity trading and emotional decisions on Groww platform. These consistently resulted in losses.

The contrast is stark: systematic approach = consistent profits, emotional approach = consistent losses."

## 🛡️ Risk Management (20 seconds)

**Show: Risk Management Section OR Quarterly Comparison**

**Script:**
"Here's what matters: I recognized these patterns early and took action. When I realized commodity trading wasn't my strength, I stopped after August. When I identified emotional trading on Groww, I stopped that too.

This self-awareness and discipline is what improved my performance by 185% from Q1 to Q2."

## 💡 Key Takeaway (25 seconds)

**Show: Interview Talking Points Section**

**Script:**
"Three things this dashboard demonstrates:

First, **real skin in the game** - I traded with my own capital, experiencing real risk.

Second, **data-driven decision making** - I analyzed what worked, doubled down on it, and cut what didn't.

Third, **self-awareness** - I recognized emotional patterns early and adapted my strategy.

This is exactly the mindset you need at Axxela: systematic, risk-aware, and adaptable."

## 🎯 Anticipated Questions & Responses

### Q: "Why did you have such large losses in October?"
**A:** "October was actually a key learning moment. I slipped back into emotional trading on Groww during a period of self-doubt. But the beautiful thing is, I recognized it immediately - that's the difference between now and Q1. In Q1, I didn't know what was going wrong. In October, I knew within days, stopped trading emotionally, and refocused on my systematic approach."

### Q: "Your commodity trading didn't work. Why?"
**A:** "Exactly - and I recognized that quickly. After seeing consistent losses through August, I made the decision to stop. This demonstrates risk management: I don't force strategies that don't work. I cut losses early and focus on my strengths, which is systematic derivative trading."

### Q: "What makes you think you can be systematic at Axxela?"
**A:** "Look at Q2 - when I'm disciplined and follow a system, I'm consistently profitable. 3 out of 3 months, 100% win rate. The data speaks for itself. I know I can execute a system when I have one, and I'm eager to learn Axxela's proven strategies."

### Q: "You're net negative overall. How is this impressive?"
**A:** "The journey matters more than a single number. Anyone can get lucky once. What matters is: Can you learn? Can you adapt? Can you recognize mistakes and fix them? Q1 to Q2 improvement of 185% shows I can. More importantly, the trajectory is upward - I'm ending FY on a systematic, profitable approach, not a loss-making one."
